This script parses an XML file (or a directory containing XML files) and wraps "ref" elements around any mention of an exhibit inside a "note" element.

An "exhibit mention" occurs case insensitive at "ex.", "ex", or "exhibit".


Usage: normalize [-f relative_filename] [-d relative_directory]


The mechanism for determining what to wrap is as follows:

1. Grab a list of "note" elements using XPath
2. Using regular expressions on the text of every "note" element:
	a. Prepend the "ref" element each time an "ex" (case insensitive) pattern was matched
	b. Jump ahead one wordgroup (a wordgroup being any combination of letters and numbers)
	c. Close the "ref" element after wordgroup (which can be assumed to be the exhibit number)

Known Bugs:

1. The script assumes everything in the directory is an XML file and will work on everything in the directory it's given.
